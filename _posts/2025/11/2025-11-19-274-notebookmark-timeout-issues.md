## Summary

This was a live coding stream working on NoteBookmark where I tried to implement web search functionality to pipe AI-generated research suggestions back to the UI. I made some progress refactoring code structure and moving classes to the right places, but hit a frustrating HTTP client timeout issue that kept cutting requests short at 30 seconds despite setting it to 5 minutes. Couldn't solve it by the end of the stream - sometimes you just need to step away and come back fresh!
