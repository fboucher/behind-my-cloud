## Summary

Continued working on FrameFisher, successfully implementing video upload, delete, and search functionality using MudBlazor. Added a threshold slider to filter search results and integrated the API to search through video content using AI-powered vector search. Of course, I had to switch back to Debian from Omarchy because my dev environment kept breaking—nothing says "professional streamer" like spending half your time fixing Linux distro issues instead of actually coding.
