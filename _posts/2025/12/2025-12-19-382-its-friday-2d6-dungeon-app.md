## Summary

Today’s stream looked like it would be an easy win: upgrade 2D6 Dungeon to .NET 10, update Aspire, ship it. Instead, it turned into a full-on debugging saga—Rider vs VS Code, Podman vs Docker, HTTPS certs on Linux, Aspire health checks, Data API Builder upgrades, and the classic “let’s upgrade everything at once” mistake. We bounced between tools, configs, branches, Copilot advice, and live chat chaos (plus plenty of digital friends jumping around), eventually proving that the old setup still works—and that something subtle broke in the upgrade path. Messy, educational, slightly unhinged… and exactly why I love live coding.
