## Summary

Spent the stream working on NotebookMark, refactoring the search criteria class to integrate the AI-powered blog search prompts into the settings so users can customize them—you know, the important stuff. We got it mostly working by the end, though apparently my laptop needed to stage a dramatic meltdown and reboot midstream to make that happen. At this point I'm pretty convinced my dev environment just enjoys watching me suffer, because clearly running Debian with .NET 9, Aspire, Docker (or Podman, whatever), and a dozen other things is just chef's kiss for stability.
