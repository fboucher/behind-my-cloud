## Summary

Wrapped up notebookmark work: upgraded Aspire, got AI-powered reading suggestions flowing, wired deletion/adding to the reading list, and surfaced settings for prompts plus favorite/blocked domains. Tweaked UI sizing, chased down missing publish dates, and wrestled with dev settings loading (because of course “development” needed a capital D). And naturally, despite all that progress, my dev environment still found new ways to implode
