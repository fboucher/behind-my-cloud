## Summary

Started a new project called Frame Fisher to analyze videos using Reka Vision API, experimenting with MudBlazer instead of Fluent UI for a fresh UI look. Got the basic grid and service wired up, then tried migrating to the new .NET solution format and switching to .NET 10—at which point everything fell apart: VS Code couldn't find the SDK, Rider had display issues, and reinstalling via different package managers left my environment in total chaos. Spent the rest of the stream rebooting, toggling between .NET 9 and 10, and wrestling with certificate trust issues on Arch, only to wrap up hungry and thoroughly annoyed that my "stable" dev setup decided to implode yet again. 🙃
