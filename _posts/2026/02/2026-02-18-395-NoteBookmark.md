## Summary

Today's stream was a bit disorganized to start with, but we managed to work on several projects including NotebookMark, an app for taking notes, which uses AI to help with tasks like generating summaries and creating tags. We also explored the possibility of using Docker with Punman CLI, and I showed off a new node for N8N that uses vision. Unfortunately, our keycloak setup didn't go as smoothly as we'd have liked, but we were able to troubleshoot some issues and get it working eventually.
