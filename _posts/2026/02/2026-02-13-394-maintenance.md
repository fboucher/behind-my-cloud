## Summary

Hey everyone! This stream was a bit of a chaotic setup adventure as I installed Omarchy on my mini PC and struggled through getting audio, monitors, and all the peripherals working – you know, typical Linux things! I showed off some dungeon crawler screen savers I built with different AI tools (Copilot Squad in Rust was a mess, but the Python version with Kiwi AI actually worked great), and we spent time relearning all those Omarchy keyboard shortcuts I'd forgotten since my last setup.
