## Summary

Hey friends! Today we wrestled with keyboards, bikes, and a bit of authentication magic as we tried to add Keycloak to our Blazor project—because who doesn’t love a good security challenge before lunch? We had some laughs, learned about realms (not the fantasy kind), and as always, I managed to break things just enough to keep it interesting. Don’t forget to get some fresh air and remember: if it works on the first try, you probably forgot to save!
