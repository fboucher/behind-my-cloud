## Summary

Bonjour, bonjour! Today was a classic Frank stream: my hair was wild, my code was wilder, and CB the chatbot decided to take a nap. We played with AI, containers, and even built a dungeon screensaver just for fun. Thanks for joining the chaos—remember, if your code works on the first try, you probably forgot to hit save!
