## Summary

Today we published a community node for N8N that's now in review, and while we're waiting for approval, I started working on version 0.44 with some fresh features. We added a video QA capability so you can ask questions about your videos and images, diving deep into TypeScript structure and figuring out how to properly organize resources and operations in the node. It was a longer stream with some complex learning moments, but we got two more functions implemented and I'm excited to see what else we can build on Friday!
