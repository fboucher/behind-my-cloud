## Summary

Today we kicked things off by exploring GitKraken's awesome new 11.8 release with features like ARM support and AI branch explanations—huge thanks to the team for always delivering such polished tools! But the real fun started when we brainstormed our new project "co-author," a tool designed to help you write blog posts from video files using AI vision APIs and Python, all containerized and ready to go. We mapped out the core features like extracting key moments from videos, managing them in a library, and handling both video URLs and local files—I'm super excited to start building this one out!
